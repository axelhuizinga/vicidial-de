vicidial-de

vicidial-de is a vicidial fork maintained by flyingpenguin.de UG in Germany.

Since for the last 10 years we have repeatedly fixed issues we found for our
European customers, we decided to make sure that we do not have to fix these
over and over again, as well as provide to the community the extra reports and
functions that we have created for our customers in a easy to access way.

vicidial-de is a fully open-source call center software solution. It allows you
to operate basically any size inbound or outbound call center or pbx from
single connection to multiple thousand connected lines or phone numbers.

vicidial-de comes with a build in minimum CRM to manage your customer contacts
and allow automatic routing of existing customers calls and automatic screen
pops with customer information.
